## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Responsive Design
The portfolio is fully responsive and adapts seamlessly to devices of all sizes, from large desktop screens to mobile devices. This was achieved using **CSS media queries** found in `mediaqueries.css` to ensure the layout adjusts based on screen size.

Key design features include:
- **Dynamic Navigation**: A hamburger menu for mobile navigation, implemented with **JavaScript** to toggle the menu visibility.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Enabled through the `scroll-behavior: smooth;` CSS property for a polished user experience.
- **Hover Effects and Transitions**: Custom hover effects on navigation links and buttons, providing visual feedback to users.

### JavaScript Functionality
The interactivity is powered by a small but efficient JavaScript function (`toggleMenu`) to manage the mobile navigation menu. This ensures the website is intuitive and easy to navigate, even on smaller screens.

```javascript
function toggleMenu() {
  const menu = document.querySelector(".menu-links");
  const icon = document.querySelector(".hamburger-icon");
  menu.classList.toggle("open");
  icon.classList.toggle("open");
}
```
